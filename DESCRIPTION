Description: The Radiolysis package is the implementation of the Warr et al. (2023) Monte Carlo models simulating the radiolysis of water and the production of hydrogen and helium in that process. Here we extend the radiolysis models to economic estimations of hydrogen and helium, by incorporating economic source area plots and deep time production estimations.
