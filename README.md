# Radiolysis
Fast and steamlined monte carlo modelling to assess geologic hydrogen and helium from lithogeochemistry

## Description

'Radiolys' is a R package that performs the Monte Carlo model of [Warr et al. (2023)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1150740/full) and extends this work by incorporating these models into economic assessments. The goal is to provide a streamlined approach to take lithogeochemical data and assess it for hydrogen or helium production. This is achieved thorugh a series of modelling and plotting functions uilizing 'dplyr' and 'ggplot'. 

## Requirements
