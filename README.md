# Radiolysis
Steamlined Monte Carlo modelling to assess naturally occurring hydrogen and helium in R.

## Description

'Radiolys' is a R package that performs the Monte Carlo model of [Warr et al. (2023)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2023.1150740/full) and extends this work by incorporating plots and modelling tools to assess the size and accumulation of potential hydrogen/helium deposits similar to petroleum systems. The goal is to provide a streamlined approach to take lithogeochemical data and assess it for hydrogen or helium potential. This is achieved through two main functions, 1) monteProd() - producing a Monte Carlo model of input samples, and 2) deepTimeProd() - backward projecting the production rates into deep time (millions of years) to assess accumualted potential. Both functions have plotting and summarization functions to digest the production models.
